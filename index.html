      <h1> Hello JAMstack</h1>
      this is my first Website ever
      <h2>My Interests</h2>
  <p>
    Hey! I'm Jay, a student at Texas A&M who’s really into technology, gaming, and learning how systems work.
    I love exploring how IT connects with business and how small improvements in tech can make big differences.
  </p>

  <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
  <p>
    When I’m not studying MIS, I enjoy video games, movies, anime, and watching college and NFL football.
    I also like experimenting with new software and learning more about coding and cybersecurity.
  </p>

  <h3>Future Goals</h3>
  <p>
    I hope to work in IT management or systems analysis, where I can help businesses
    use technology more efficiently while keeping things secure and user-friendly.
  </p>

  <p>Thanks for visiting!</p>
